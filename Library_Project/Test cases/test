# Time Series Data Library (C) - Test Cases

## Overview

This document outlines test cases for the Time Series Data Library. The tests cover various functionalities, including time series data manipulation, hardware interaction, and compatibility with other programming languages.

## Test Environment

- Compiler: [Specify the compiler used]
- Operating System: [Specify the OS used]
- Dependencies: [List any dependencies or tools required for testing]

## Test Cases

### 1. Time Series Data Manipulation

#### Scenario: Initialize and add data points

**Test Steps:**
1. Initialize a time series data structure.
2. Add multiple data points to the time series.

**Expected Result:**
- The time series should be initialized without errors.
- Data points should be added successfully.

#### Scenario: Retrieve data points within a time range

**Test Steps:**
1. Initialize a time series data structure.
2. Add data points to the time series.
3. Retrieve data points within a specified time range.

**Expected Result:**
- Data points within the specified time range should be retrieved successfully.

### 2. Hardware Interaction

#### Scenario: Collect data from hardware

**Test Steps:**
1. Initialize a time series data structure.
2. Simulate collecting data from hardware.

**Expected Result:**
- Data should be collected from hardware without errors.
- Time series should be updated with collected data.

### 3. Compatibility with Other Programming Languages (Python)

#### Scenario: Initialize and manipulate time series data using Python

**Test Steps:**
1. Import the time_series_data module in Python.
2. Initialize a time series data structure.
3. Collect data from hardware using Python.
4. Retrieve data points within a time range using Python.

**Expected Result:**
- The time series data structure should be initialized and manipulated successfully using Python.

## Test Execution

1. Compile the library and test cases using the specified compiler.
2. Execute the compiled test cases.
3. Verify the results against the expected results.
